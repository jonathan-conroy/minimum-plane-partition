# Minimum Partition Into Plane Subgraphs
Exploration of the [2022 CG Challenge](https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/competition/cg-shop-2022/#problem-description)
by the [Tufts Computational Geometry Research Group](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/research/geometry/).

Progress so far:
- Naive (but relatively fast) construction of intersection graph from JSON instance.
- Code to find small colorings on intesection graphs with repeated calls to the HEAD k-coloring algorithm.

Next steps:
- Explicit representations intersection graphs are often too large (>18 GB for `sqrpecn56236`). Should modify HEAD code to interpret implicit (geometric) representation.
- Investigate other coloring algorithms.
    - HEAD (and other memetic algorithms) appears to be commonly used for smaller instances (<1000 vertices).
    - One method for dealing with larger graphs (900-4000 vertices) is to iteratively remove maximal independent sets from the graph to reduce the number of vertices to a more manageable number. For example, see the [IE2COL algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X12002429), though the authors have not published their code.
    - For massive sparse graphs (with millions of vertices), other approaches are used â€” see ["A Reduction based Method for Coloring Very Large Graphs"](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0073.pdf) and ["A Hybrid Approach for Exact Coloring of Massive Graphs"](https://hal.laas.fr/hal-02076298/file/paper.pdf).

File Structure:
- `parseInstances/parse.cpp`: An implementation of a naive construction for an intersection graph from a JSON instance. Outputs graph in DIMACS format.
- `HEAD/`: Contains an implementation of HEAD ("Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm in Duet") [provided](https://github.com/graphcoloring/HEAD) by the authors of [the paper introducing the algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-017-9354-9). Also contains `run_all.cpp`, which runs uses HEAD to find a small coloring for all intersection graphs in the `intersection_graphs/` directory.
- `installation.md`: Running notes on dependencies and installation instructions
- `test_graph.txt`: Small example graph in the DIMACS format
- `instances/`: Ignored by Git. Should contain JSON files from [the challenge website](https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/competition/cg-shop-2022/#problem-description).
- `intersection_graphs/`: Ignored by Git. Should contain intersection graphs generated by `parseInstances/parse.cpp`
- `output/`: Ignored by Git. Should contain output colors from `HEAD/`
